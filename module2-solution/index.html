  <p>A black cat is a domestic cat with black fur, which may be a specific breed or a common domestic cat of no particular or mixed breed.
 Most black cats have golden irises due to their high melanin pigment content. Black cats are the subject of mythology, legend, and superstition, often associated with witches and good or bad luck in European folklore.</p>

  <div class="section-title orange">Orange cats</div>
  <p>Orange cats, often referred to as ginger or yellow cats, are characterized by their golden, orange, or cream-colored coats. These cats are not a specific breed but rather a coat color and pattern seen across many domestic cats. These cats usually feature a mackerel tabby pattern or classic tabby swirls, and often have the telltale "M" marking on their foreheads.</p>

  <div class="section-title tuxedo">Tuxedo cats</div>
  <p>Tuxedo cats are not a specific breed but rather a distinct color and pattern of cats that can occur across many different breeds. They are known for their piebald coat patterns, which resemble formal wear, with a black coat and white patches on the chest, belly, paws, and sometimes the chin. The term "tuxedo cat" is typically used for black-and-white colored cats, but tuxedo patterned cats can come in all cat colors</p>
